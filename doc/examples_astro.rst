        Most of these examples can be launched as online interactive notebooks
        thanks to the infrastructure provided by <a href="https://mybinder.org/">binder</a>.
        Look for the rocket icon <i class="fas fa-rocket"></i> on top of each page!

  .. important::

     Some examples may use features not available yet in the latest stable release
     of heyoka.py, and thus might fail to execute correctly in the online interactive
     notebooks. Please refer to the :ref:`changelog <changelog>` for an overview of
     the features currently
     available only in the development version of heyoka.py.
