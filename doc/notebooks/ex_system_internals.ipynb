    "The first and most important thing to understand about heyoka.py's expressions is that they implement so-called *reference semantics*. That is, an expression is essentially a handle to an underlying object, and copying the expression will not perform an actual copy, rather it will return a new reference to the same underlying object.\n",

    "Before you ask \"isn't this how all Python objects work?\", let me immediately point out that heyoka.py's expressions are exposed from C++ and that reference semantics is implemented all the way down into the C++ layer. As a concrete example of what this means, consider the following simple expression:"
