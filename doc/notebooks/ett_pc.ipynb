    "# Computing collision probabilities with ETTs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we introduce an efficient method for computing the probability of collision during a close encounter (i.e., a conjunction) between two Earth-orbiting satellites. We assume that the nominal state at the time of closest approach (TCA), together with its associated uncertainty, is known. In operational contexts, this information is typically provided in the form of a [conjunction data message (CDM)](https://ccsds.org/publications/bluebooks/entry/3064/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The collision probability is estimated using a Monte Carlo approach, but with a key difference from conventional implementations. Instead of numerically propagating each sampled initial condition to the time of closest approach, we exploit variational equations to construct an event-transition tensor (ETT) using a *single* numerical propagation. This tensor defines a Taylor map that directly relates the initial state uncertainty to the state on the event manifold. As a result, expensive orbit propagations and repeated relative distance/velocity checks are replaced by fast power-series evaluations, enabling a significant reduction in computational cost while preserving accuracy.\n",
