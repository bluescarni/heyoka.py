    "# Computing event sensitivity\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will show how it is possible to use heyoka.py's [event detection](<./Event detection.ipynb>) system to compute the first-order *sensitivity* of an event's trigger time. For the sake of simplicity, we will consider here a dynamical system with a single parameter and we will consider only the sensitivity with respect to this parameter. The approach can easily be generalised to the computation of the sensitivities with respect to multiple parameters and/or the initial conditions.\n",

    "In order to illustrate the method, we will be focusing on an analytically-solvable system of ODEs, so that we will be able to determine an explicit expression for the sensitivity which we will then use to validate the numerical computation.\n",
