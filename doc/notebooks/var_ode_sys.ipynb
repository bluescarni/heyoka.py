The derivatives with respect to the initial conditions, for instance, are needed for the computation of [chaos indicators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_exponent) and for [uncertainty propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty), and they can also be used to propagate a small neighborhood in phase space around the initial conditions.

The former approach is used by libraries such as [pyaudi](https://github.com/darioizzo/audi), [desolver](https://github.com/Microno95/desolver) and [TaylorIntegration.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/TaylorIntegration/stable/jet_transport/), while differentiable programming is popular in the machine learning community with projects such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

    "- in the astrodynamics community, the term *differential algebra* is often used to refer to the computation of partial derivatives via truncated Taylor polynomials (e.g., see [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10569-010-9283-5)). The term actually originates from the community of beam physics, where it has been used in the context of the theoretical modelling of particle accelerators since the 90s (e.g., see [this review](https://www.bmtdynamics.org/pub/papers/DAHAPE12/DAHAPE12.pdf));\n",
    "- in the mathematical community, the term *jet transport* is sometimes used to refer to the propagation of a small neighborhood in phase space around the initial conditions via the Taylor series constructed form the partial derivatives (e.g., see [this paper](http://www.maia.ub.es/~angel/varis/granada09.pdf)). In heyoka.py, we refer to a similar idea as {ref}`Taylor map evaluation <taylor_map>`;\n",
    "- in the Julia programming language community, the term *local sensitivity analysis* refers to the computation of the partial derivatives via the variational equations, while *discrete sensitivity analysis* refers to the computation of the partial derivatives by directly differentiating the numerical method's steps (e.g., see [this review](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01892));\n",
    "- in the space engineering community, the term *state transition tensors* is sometimes used to indicate the generalisations of the [state transition matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-transition_matrix) (which in turn is built from the first-order partial derivatives) to higher differentiation orders.\n",

This is accomplished by using the values of the partial derivatives to construct and evaluate the multivariate Taylor series of the solution around the original initial conditions/parameters of the system. This approach, when applied to perturbations on the initial conditions, is sometimes called *jet transport* in the literature. Here, more generally, we will call it *evaluation of the Taylor map*.\n",
