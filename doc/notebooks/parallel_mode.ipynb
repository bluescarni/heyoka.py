    "# Parallel mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from version 0.18.0, heyoka.py can automatically parallelise\n",
    "the integration of a single ODE system using multiple threads\n",
    "of execution. This parallelisation\n",
    "mode is fine-grained, i.e., it acts at the level of an individual\n",
    "integration step, and it thus serves a fundamentally different purpose from\n",
    "the coarse-grained parallelisation approach of [ensemble propagations](<./ensemble_mode.ipynb>).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be effective, parallel mode needs large ODE systems, that is, systems\n",
    "with a large number of variables and/or large expressions at the right-hand side.\n",
    "When used on small ODE systems, parallel mode will likely introduce a noticeable\n",
    "slowdown due to the multithreading overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, because Taylor integrators are memory intensive, performance\n",
    "for large ODE systems is bottlenecked by RAM speed due to the\n",
    "[memory wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory#Memory_wall).\n",
    "This means, in practice, that, at least for double-precision computations,\n",
    "the performance of parallel mode will not scale linearly with the number of cores.\n",
    "On the other hand, for extended-precision computations the speedup will be more efficient,\n",
    "due to the fact that arithmetic operations on extended-precision operands\n",
    "are computationally heavier than on double-precision operands.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these caveats out of the way, let us see an example of parallel mode in action.\n",

    "a Sun-like star. The protoplanets interact with the star and with each other according to\n",
    "Newtonian gravity, and they are initially placed on circular orbits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin by defining a ``run_benchmark()`` function that will setup and integrate\n",
    "the N-body system. The function is parametrised over the floating-point type ``fp_type`` that\n",
    "will be used for the integration (so that we can easily run the same test in both double\n",
    "and extended precision). The input arguments are the final time and a boolean flag\n",
