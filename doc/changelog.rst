------------------

New
~~~

  is taken by a ``propagate_*()`` function
  (`#128 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/128>`__).

  API. These vectorised overloads allow to perform the same

  classes
  (`#122 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/122>`__).
- Several additions to the :ref:`compiled functions <cfunc_tut>` API:
  compiled functions can now
  be pickled/unpickled, and they expose several information as
  read-only properties (e.g., list of variables, outputs, etc.)
  (`#120 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/120>`__).
- Expressions now support hashing
  (`#120 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/120>`__).
- New ``model`` submodule containing ready-made dynamical models
  (`#119 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/119>`__).

Changes
~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING**: the VSOP2013 functions have been moved from the
  main module to the new ``model`` submodule
  (`#130 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/130>`__).
  This is a :ref:`breaking change <bchanges_1_0_0>`.
- The custom NumPy memory manager that prevents memory leaks
  with ``real`` arrays is now disabled by default
  (`#129 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/129>`__).
- The step callbacks are now deep-copied in multithreaded
  :ref:`ensemble propagations <ensemble_prop>`
  rather then being shared among threads. The aim of this change
  is to reduce the likelihood of data races
  (`#128 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/128>`__).
- Comprehensive overhaul of the expression system, including:
  enhanced automatic simplification capabilities for sums,
  products and powers, removal of several specialised primitives
  (such as ``square()``, ``neg()``, ``sum_sq()``, etc.),
  re-implementation of division and subtraction as special
  cases of product and sum, and more
  (`#127 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/127>`__).
- heyoka.py now requires at least version 1.0.0 of the
  heyoka C++ library
  (`#127 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/127>`__).

  function in the new ``model`` submodule
  (`#119 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/119>`__).

  ``np.longdouble`` in the heyoka.py API
  (`#99 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/99>`__,

  in the event detection API
  (`#37 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/37>`__).
- heyoka.py now requires at least version 0.8.0 of the
  heyoka C++ library
  (`#37 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/37>`__).

0.7.0 (2021-04-22)
------------------

New
~~~

- The ``propagate_*()`` functions now accept an optional
  ``max_delta_t`` argument to limit the size of a timestep,
  and an optional ``callback`` argument that will be invoked
  at the end of each timestep
  (`#34 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/34>`__).
- ``update_d_output()`` can now be called with a relative
  (rather than absolute) time argument
  (`#34 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/34>`__).

Changes
~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING**: the time coordinates in batch integrators
  cannot be directly modified any more, and the new
  ``set_time()`` function must be used instead
  (`#34 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/34>`__).
- heyoka.py now requires at least version 0.7.0 of the
  heyoka C++ library

------------------

New
~~~

- Add the wavy ramp tutorial
  (`#32 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/32>`__).

Changes
~~~~~~~

  (`#29 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/29>`__).
- Add a tutorial about the computation of Poincaré sections
  (`#27 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/27>`__).
- Add a tutorial on optimal control
  (`#24 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/24>`__).
- Initial version of the event detection system
  (`#23 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/23>`__).
- Expose low-level functions to compute the jet of derivatives
  for an ODE system
  (`#21 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/21>`__).

Changes
~~~~~~~

- **BREAKING**: the ``propagate_grid()`` method now requires
  monotonically-ordered grid points
  (`#25 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/25>`__).
- heyoka.py now depends on the `spdlog <https://github.com/gabime/spdlog>`__ library
  (`#23 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/23>`__).

  heyoka C++ library
  (`#21 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/21>`__).

Fix
~~~

- Properly restore the original ``mpmath`` precision after
  importing heyoka.py
  (`#21 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/21>`__).

0.5.0 (2021-02-25)
------------------

New
~~~

- Expose symbolic differentiation.
- Add a new tutorial (restricted three-body problem).

Changes
~~~~~~~

- The interface of the integrator in batch mode has changed
  to work with arrays in which the batch size has its own dimension,
  instead of being flattened out
  (`#20 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/20>`__).
- heyoka.py now depends on the `{fmt} <https://fmt.dev/latest/index.html>`__ library
  (`#20 <https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py/pull/20>`__).
- heyoka.py now requires at least version 0.5.0 of the
